Data file holds the data points for a Mach number vs x-distance curve as seen in the image. 
Data is extracted in point format with connectivity information. Uses linked lists to store the data and point to next object.

Extract maximum Mach value and plateau max mach number as defining features.
Plateau mach number is defined as the average value between the Mach number value and the second peak. (refer to the image)

Input: data.dat
Output: crosswindMis.dat
